   and have configured routes and addresses for them. I have also secured my
   services behind firewalls and strong SSH configurations.
 - I am presently using Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud to host my build
   infrastructure for my private projects. I have a comprehensive understanding
   of the principles of working in a cloud environment.

   builds faster.
 - I am proficient in diagnosing most common computer problems that users may
   encounter on a day-to-day basis.
 - I have five servers that I operate at home, which host a variety of services
   such as Plex, Deluge, and private Git support. I use Ubuntu Server for all
   of my servers, and I manage them myself through SSH sessions.

   it convenient to install them on my local servers.
