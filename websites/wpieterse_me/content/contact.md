I appreciate your reaching out.

If you have an issue with one of the projects I maintain, please contact me
directly on the specific project. Each project I develop has an issue tracker,
which we can use to discuss the details. You can find a list of projects I am
involved in on the [Projects][projects] page on the navigation bar.

If you would like to contact me directly, there are a few ways to do so:

 - Via a [WhatsApp][contact-whatsapp]
 - Via an [e-mail][contact-mail]
 - Via a [telephone call][contact-telephone]

I endeavor to answer all messages promptly. If I do not respond in a timely
manner, it is likely that I am busy with work or other obligations. I will get
back to you as soon as possible.
