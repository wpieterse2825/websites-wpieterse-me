Greetings, I am Wynand Pieterse, and welcome to my website.

I am a 30-something-year-old individual residing in the heart of South Africa,
Johannesburg. I enjoy spending time with [Jesus][jesus-1], making time to be
alone with Him. I believe He is the [Alpha and the Omega][jesus-2], and the
only One we can lean on during these difficult times.

I enjoy working with computers. My fascination with computers began in my
teens. For the past 20+ years, I have taught myself how to develop programs for
[Windows][windows] and [Linux][linux], using various programming languages such
as [C][c]/[C++][cpp], [C#][csharp], and [Python][python]. I enjoy working with
various cloud providers, my favorite being [Google Cloud][gcp]. I also dabble
with [AWS][aws], [Oracle Cloud][oci] and [Azure][azure] from time to time.

I am self-taught, and I take every opportunity to learn new techniques and hone
my skills so that I can develop idiomatic solutions for any problem. If you
like what you see, be sure to head over to my [resume][resume] page to learn
more, if reach out to me on via one of the methods on my [contact][contact]
page.

At the moment, I am employed at [Pixel Perfect][pixelperfect], a leading
hosting and web-design company located in Cape Town.
